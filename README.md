## Overview
This project implements a CycleGAN model, leveraging the [CycleGAN and pix2pix repository](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix), to perform real-time transformations on input images. The focus is on altering clothing styles in a live webcam feed.

## Project Structure
- `GAN_final_project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing the final project, including model training and evaluation.
- `GAN_Project-code_for_live_inference.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for executing live inference using the trained CycleGAN model.
- `Link_to_open_source-cycleGAN.txt`: A reference link to the CycleGAN and pix2pix GitHub repository used as the base model.

Results
The results include real-time image transformations showcasing clothing swaps and other feature modifications. Below is an example of the live inference output:![Screenshot 2024-08-30 161715](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10e5ae5c-d5ac-4de3-aeee-7834ffdd4648)
